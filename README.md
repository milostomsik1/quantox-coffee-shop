# Quantox - Coffee Shop App

Live preview is available at: https://milostomsik.000webhostapp.com/

I have left all of the working files to give some insight on my workflow and thought process.

Technologies used:
1. Vanilla JS (ES5)
2. Vanilla CSS, no frameworks
3. Gulp build system

All needed notation is left in form of comments within the code.
Code would be a lot cleaner and efficient if ES6 and jQuery were used but I wanted to provide example of vanilla JS code.

Possible improvements:
* Continuous user geolocation tracking
* Google map auto-centering
* Preview of shop when map marker is clicked (same info as in list)
* Audio accessibility
